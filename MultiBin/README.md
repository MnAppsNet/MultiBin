# MultiBin
MultiBin is a very useful tool that allows you to keep track of everything you have copies,
so you can easily recall the later. It is capable to keep track of texts, images and files
from you clipboard.
The shortcut used to open and interact with MultiBin is CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE but it can be easily
change from within the code. An user option for custom shortcut is a possibility but hasn't been
implemented due to the fact that the app is beeing used personaly.
