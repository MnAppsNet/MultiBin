# MultiBin
**MultiBin** is a very useful tool that allows you to keep track of everything you have copies,
so you can easily recall them later. It is capable to keep track of **texts**, **images** and **files**
from you clipboard.
The shortcut used to open and interact with **MultiBin** is **CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE** but it can be easily
changed from within the code. An user option for custom shortcut is a possibility but hasn't been
implemented due to the fact that the app is beeing used personaly.
